The following plots can be obtained from [https://energy-charts.info/charts/power/chart.htm?l=en&c=DE](energy-charts.info) and selecting the country.

### Switzerland
Switzerland's electricity production is CO2 free

Observations

* The load peaks around lunch are relatively narrow (compared to Germany and the EU, below)

* Peak capacity can be met easily.

* No intention to meet the low-level load requirements?


### Germany 
Germany relies heavily on CO2 emitting energy sources (brown coal, coal, fossil gas)

Observations

* For the current level of energy storage there is already too much solar power installed in Germany (note that the *public* solar power generation is less than the *total* shown here. Electricity generation at lunch exceeds the requirements, but only at lunch. It does not extend sufficiently into the morning and afternoon. This can be taken as an argument that *more* solar power installations would help in those hours. 

* Solar power is quite reliable, when looking at all of Germany (around lunch). Wind power is completely dominated by on-shore and shows very substantial variations on a weekly (daily) basis. 

* The amount of CO2 emitting energy sources is quite striking.

### The EU

Observations

* The relative importance of nuclear power is substantially increased compared to Germany.

* As in Germany, fossil gas enables the increased power needs for industry and for much of the daily variation.
