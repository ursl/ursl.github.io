At face value the numbers indicate that the civilian loss of life in the Ukraine war, normalized to the military loss of life (of the defending military), is much smaller than in the Iraq war. All screen shots (taken on Aug 25, 2022) below are links to the original publications. 

The ratio between military and civilian (fatal) casualties in the Ukraine war (Feb 24 - August, 2022) is around **9000/5500**:

The ratio between military and civilian (fatal) casualties in the Iraq war (2003 - 2010/11) is more disputed, but the ratio seems much worse for the civilians at around **~30000/100000**. The number 100,000 is at the *very far* low end of the estimates, taking higher numbers does not change the observation of this post. 30,000 is from the fatality count of the "insurgents".

As noted in the wikipedia page, all Iraq war numbers are disputed.
