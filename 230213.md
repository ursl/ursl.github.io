Most years have 8760 hours. Here, efficiency is calculated as (yearly electrical energy produced [GWh]/installed power [GW])/8760h. This is the same as 
(yearly electrical energy produced [GWh])/(8760*installed power [GW]), in case it's not obvious.

Wind and solar power are intermittent. Energy storage solutions do not (yet) provide adequate capacity.

In Switzerland [link](https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/wirtschaft/energie/energie---fakten-und-zahlen.html)
* electricity constitutes 26% of the energy consumption
* electricity production
 * 62% hydropower
 * 29% nuclear power
 * 9% rest (renewables and others) 
* the yearly electricity consumption amounts to ca 63TWh = 63000GWh.
* per capita this is ca 6.5MWh, i.e. 17.8kWh/day.

# Wind farms in  Switzerland

## JUVENT
[JUVENT](https://www.juvent.ch/de/windkraftwerk/uebersicht) is the largest wind farm in Switzerland, owned(?) by BKW. Since 2016 a total of (nominal) 37.2MW is operational. 
Over the past three years, on average ca. 82GWh were produced per year. This corresponds to an average efficiency of ca. **25%**.

## CalandaWind
[CalandaWind](https://www.calandawind.ch) is placed very prominently next to the freeway in the Rhine valley between Trimmis and Chur. No real performance numbers are provided on their website, but summarily
3MW installed power and an average yearly electrical energy production of 4.5GWh is claimed. This corresponds to an average efficiency of ca. **17%**.

# Solar plants in Switzerland

## GondoSolar
[GondoSolar](https://www.gondosolar.ch/das-projekt) is not yet installed, but the numbers may be illustrative of the current state of the art at an optimal position. With an installed peak electrical power of 18MW the yearly expected electrical energy production is 23.3 GWh. This corresponds to an efficiency of ca **15%**.

# Baseline comparison (nuclear power plants)
[KKW Goesgen](https://www.kkg.ch) is a large nuclear power plant (1GW electrical net power) that produces ca. 8000 GWh per year ([link](https://www.kkg.ch/de/ueber-uns/medienmitteilungen/jahresabschluss-2021.html))
This corresponds to an average efficiency of **91.3%**.
