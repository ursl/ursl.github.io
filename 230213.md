# Wind farms in  Switzerland

Most years have 8760 hours. Here, efficiency is calculated as (yearly electrical energy produced [GWh]/installed power [GW])/8760h.

## JUVENT
[JUVENT](https://www.juvent.ch/de/windkraftwerk/uebersicht) is the largest wind farm in Switzerland, owned(?) by BKW. Since 2016 a total of (nominal) 37.2MW is operational. 
Over the past two years, on average ca. 80GWh were produced per year. This corresponds to an average efficiency of ca. 25%.

## CalandaWind
[CalandaWind](https://www.calandawind.ch) is placed very prominently next to the freeway in the Rhine valley between Trimmis and Chur. No real performance numbers are provided on their website, but summarily
3MW installed power and an average yearly electrical energy production of 4.5GWh is claimed. This corresponds to an average efficiency of ca. 17%.

## Baseline comparison (nuclear power plants)
[KKW Goesgen](https://www.kkg.ch) is a large nuclear power plant (1GW electrical net power) that produces ca. 8000 GWh per year [link](https://www.kkg.ch/de/ueber-uns/medienmitteilungen/jahresabschluss-2021.html)
This corresponds to an average efficiency of 91.3%.
